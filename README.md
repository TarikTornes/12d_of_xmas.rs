## twelve\_days\_of\_xmas.rs

This is a small project suggested by "The Rust Programming Language Book" in end of chapter 3.
This snippet of code prints the song "12 days of Christmas" by making use of its repetition. The following tools from the book were used:
- cargo package manager
- arrays & slicing
- control flow through loops
- functions
